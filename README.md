I used SVGs to create an animation using javascript. I wanted to be able to create an animation that would give me the desired blinking effect. There were issues when trying to do this with CSS because the animations were either glitching or not giving me the desired result. In the end I in a sense created a GIF using javascript. It uses a series of SVGs as frames. This allows for better tweening and tweaking between each frame. However the process is tedious as you have to create seperate frames for the animation. The good thing is that the sizes of the SVGs are not a major problem. They are also easily editable when needed.
